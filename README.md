This is a Recipe finder Website. It has three pages not including the Home page.
Recipes, Nutrition, and Ingredients.
All the same basic format.
In the recipes page you will find a picture and how to make said recipe.
In the Nutrition Page you will find the calories for each meal.
In the ingredients page you will find a list of ingredients for each meal you choose.

The API works by the following:
Step 1: It starts by collecting the users input.
Step 2: It takes that input to the server and asks for the input.
Step 3: The server gives the requested data to the website.
Step 4: The site displays that data to the user.
